- Create Linked list at program start, should be empty
- Create two insert functions to add to the list, one from keyboard and one from file
- Delete functions to free memory from the list and move the pointers around appropriately
- Search function that finds substrings in the list and returns the line number found in the terminal (We can use the old string compare functions we made earlier)
- Edit function that calls delete and insert functions to make changes to the list
- Write functions to write the current list to the txt file and close before exiting
